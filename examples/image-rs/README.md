# img-parts example with the image crate

This example shows how the img-parts crate can be combined with the `image`
crate to resize an image while keeping the original ICCP and EXIF metadata.

_cd_ into this directory and run it with

```shell
cargo run <input jpg, png or webp> <output jpg or png with appropriate extension>
```
